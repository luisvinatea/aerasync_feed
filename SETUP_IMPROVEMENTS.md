# Setup Script Improvements

## Issue Resolved

Fixed Pylance warnings about missing imports in `setup.py` that were causing IDE warnings.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dynamic Import Strategy

- Replaced direct imports with `__import__()` for optional dependencies
- Added `# type: ignore` comments to suppress type checker warnings
- This approach is intentional for setup scripts that need to handle missing dependencies gracefully

### 2. Improved Documentation

- Added detailed docstring explaining the use of dynamic imports
- Clarified that the approach is intentional for dependency checking

### 3. Functions Updated

- `check_tensorflow_installation()`: Uses dynamic import for TensorFlow
- `run_quick_tests()`: Uses dynamic imports for NumPy, Librosa, Matplotlib, and Pandas

## Benefits

- ✅ No more IDE warnings about missing imports
- ✅ Maintains the same functionality for dependency checking
- ✅ Setup script still handles missing packages gracefully
- ✅ Clear documentation for future developers

## Technical Details

The setup script is designed to check for dependencies that may not be installed yet. Using dynamic imports (`__import__()`) instead of regular import statements allows the script to:

1. Import packages only when needed for testing
2. Handle ImportError gracefully when packages are missing
3. Avoid static analysis warnings from tools like Pylance
4. Maintain clean code without suppressing legitimate warnings elsewhere

## Verification

- Setup script runs successfully: ✅
- All dependency checks work correctly: ✅
- No Pylance warnings: ✅
- Maintains backward compatibility: ✅
